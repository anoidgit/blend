File Overiew
====================================================================

/blend/ - This is a directory contains feature files.
    /testFeat.txt 
        - This file stores features extracted from the test file 
          (newstest2017.uedin-nmt.4890.ru-en in this sample).
    /testFeat.txt.scale
        - This file stores features of testFeat.txt that are scaled to be in [-1,1].
    /trainFeat.txt
        - This file contains features extracted from the training file
          (train.mt-system.toen in this sample).
    /trainFeat.txt.scale
        - This file contains features of trainFeat.txt that are scaled to be in [-1,1].
    /trainFeat.txt.range
        - This file stores scaling factors of trainFeat.txt, which are used for scaling
          the test features.

/cmd.sh - This file stores commands for training and testing process.

/data/  - This directory stores preprocessing result files of the training and the testing data

/newstest2017-ruen-ref.en - This is the original reference file of the test data.
/newstest2017-ruen-src.ru - This is the original source file of the test data.
/newstest2017.uedin-nmt.4890.ru-en - This is the original machine translation (MT) file of the test data.

/readme - This is the file you are reading.

/run-test.sh - This file contains all commands of the testing process.

/run-train.sh - This file contains all commands of the training process.

/scores/ - This directory contains scores given to the MT files by all incorporated metrics

/train.human.toen -This is the human evaluation results file of the train data.
/train.mt-system.toen - This is the original MT file of the train data .
/train.reference.toen - This is the original reference file of the train data.
/train.source.toen - This is the original source file of the train data.

/testFeat.txt.blend - This is the scores given to the MT file of the test data by metric Blend.

Note:
Besides the shell scripts, the 3 files of the test data and the 4 files of the train data 
need to be provided, all other files and directories are generated automaticly when running.

Usage
====================================================================
> ./run-train.sh src_file ref_file mt_file human_DA_file src_lan trg_lan

Train a model that can be used to compute the Blend scores of the test data.

> ./run-test.sh src_file ref_file mt_file src_lan trg_lan

Compute the Blend scores given to the MT file of the test data using the trained model.

> ./cmd.sh

A sample command file for training and testing.

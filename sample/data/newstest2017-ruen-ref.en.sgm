<seg id="73">is it worth going to a health resort if you don &apos;t have any health problems ?</seg>
<seg id="74">our expert : head doctor of a health resort , olga bogush .</seg>
<seg id="75">if a person is healthy , but just burnt-out from work , should they bother going to a health resort ?</seg>
<seg id="76">a health resort vacation is essential to us not only in terms of treatment , but also for the prevention of illnesses .</seg>
<seg id="77">in the setting of a health resort , a person can check the state of their body and receive recommendations from a doctor about how to live so that their health does not fall apart .</seg>
<seg id="78">these types of recommendations are useful to everyone .</seg>
<seg id="79">‘ i &apos;m just burnt-out from work ’ , is an important signal from the body that shouldn &apos;t be dismissed .</seg>
<seg id="80">constant stress and mental and physical exhaustion can lead to depression and chronic fatigue syndrome .</seg>
<seg id="81">but about 90 % of visitors feel stressed .</seg>
<seg id="82">moreover , the people who are most susceptible to it are from large cities and between the ages of 45 and 55 .</seg>
<seg id="83">so , it &apos;s best to not compound matters and give yourself time to relax before it ’ s too late .</seg>
<seg id="84">studies show that 98 % of people lower their biological age during a stay at a health resort .</seg>
<seg id="85">modern health resorts offer a comfortable stay for the whole family .</seg>
<seg id="86">so , if you want to spend your vacation with the children , you won &apos;t have to part ways with them .</seg>
<seg id="87">wellness programmes are available for children , even the very youngest , which include not only diagnostic services , consultations with a paediatrician , and tests , but also therapeutic services .</seg>
<seg id="88">for example : swimming ( there are children &apos;s pools at many health resorts ) , inhalation therapy , specialised dietary regimes , massage , oxygen cocktails , and physiotherapy .</seg>
<seg id="89">a doctor determines a course of treatment taking into account patient-specific indications and the particular characteristics of the growing body .</seg>
<seg id="90">in addition , health resorts usually offer a children &apos;s club with activity coordinators , where children can explore play activities and various workshops .</seg>
<seg id="91">some health resorts even open their doors to guests with infants , providing babies with the necessary conditions and offering the services of an experienced nanny .</seg>
<seg id="92">mild winters , long summers , and an abundance of sunny days each year ( more than 300 ) create the perfect conditions for year-round recreation at the resorts of the caucasian mineral waters .</seg>
<seg id="93">after all , the body needs rest not only during the summertime .</seg>
<seg id="94">so , there &apos;s no need to fear the weather outside , especially since the majority of procedures are conducted indoors and are in no way dependant on the season .</seg>
<seg id="95">in general , it is advisable to undergo treatment at a health resort 2 times a year , especially for people of a mature age .</seg>
<seg id="96">the main draw of the caucasian mineral waters region is , of course , its healing mineral springs : slavyanovsky , smirnovsky , yessentuki , and narzan .</seg>
<seg id="97">their waters possess unique properties and act on different systems of the body .</seg>
<seg id="98">the water differs in terms of temperature , the amount of salt , total mineralisation , and chemical and gas composition .</seg>
<seg id="99">a doctor chooses the water depending on the patient ’ s wellbeing .</seg>
<seg id="100">for example , narzan has anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects , and repairs the function of the gastrointestinal tract and the metabolism .</seg>

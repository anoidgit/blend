<seg id="74">our expert is the main doctor of the sanatorium olga bogush .</seg>
<seg id="75">and if the person is healthy , just tired of work , should he go to the sanatorium ?</seg>
<seg id="76">spa recreation is necessary not only for treatment , but also for prevention of diseases .</seg>
<seg id="77">in the conditions of the sanatorium , the person can check the condition of his body and obtain the advice of the doctor how to live so that his health is not destroyed .</seg>
<seg id="78">such recommendations will not be superfluous .</seg>

<seg id="92">soft winter , long summer , an abundance of sunny days a year ( over 300 ) create good conditions for year-round rest in the resorts of caucasian mineral water .</seg>
<seg id="93">and then the body needs rest not only in summer .</seg>

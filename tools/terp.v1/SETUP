TERp Version 0.1
3/9/2009

The installation process is still very much beta.  If you run into any
problems, feel free to contact the author at snover@cs.umd.edu.

More Detailed Instructions and Documentation:
http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~snover/terp/doc_v1.html
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

These instructions are for use on a UNIX-like operating system.  

1) TERp requires Java version 1.5.0 or higher.

2) Download and install WordNet version 3.0 from
   http://wordnet.princeton.edu/obtain

3) Download the TERp code from:
   http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~snover/terp/downloads/terp.v1.tgz
   (You've probably already done this if you are reading this)

4) Download the TERp phrase table from:
   http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~snover/terp/downloads/terp-pt.v1.tgz
   (This file is 122 MB and so is distributed separately from the main
   TERp code)

5) Unzip and untar the TERp code and TERp phrase table.
   tar xvfz terp.v1.tgz
   tar xvfz terp-pt.v1.tgz

6) Several shell scripts are provided to simplify the process of
   running TERp.  To setup these scripts run:
   bin/setup_bin.sh <PATH_TO_TERP> <PATH_TO_JAVA> <PATH_TO_WORDNET>
     where 

   <PATH_TO_TERP> points to the TERp directory that was downloaded in
       step 3 and untarred in step 5, such that
       PATH_TO_TERP/bin/setup_bin.sh exists

   <PATH_TO_JAVA> points to the root of the Java 1.5.0+ directory such
       that PATH_TO_JAVA/bin/java exists
           
   <PATH_TO_WORDNET> points to the root of the WordNet-3.0
       installation such that PATH_TO_WORDNET/dict exists

   This step will create the following scripts:
      bin/terp
      bin/terpa
      bin/terp_ter
      bin/tercom
      bin/create_phrasedb
      bin/optimize_db

    and create the parameter file:
      data/data_loc.param

7) Generate the phrase table database from the paraphrase phrase table
   text file downloaded in step 4 and untarred in step 5.

   Run the command:
     bin/create_phrasedb <PHRASE_TABLE_TEXT> data/phrases.db

			**IMPORTANT** 
   This step could take a while and will require several gigabytes of
   diskspace, as the text version of the phrase table is converted to
   a Berkley style database.  The conversion tool also expects to have
   1-3 GBs of memory available.  This requirement can be reduced if
   necessary in the bin/create_phrasedb script.

   This step will generate a phrase table database in data/phrases.db.
   Running this step again will add to the existing database, not
   overwrite it.

8) You can run some validation experiments to test the installation.

From the main directory of TERp run:

> ./bin/create_phrasedb test/sample.pt.txt test/sample.pt.db
> ./bin/terpa test/sample.terp.param

This will create a small phrase database from the file
'test/sample.pt.txt' and store that database as 'test/sample.pt.db'

TERpA will then be run on the hypothesis and reference files in
'test/' with the output placed in 'test/output/' as specified in the
'test/sample.terp.param' parameter file.  The correct version of these
output files is provided in 'test/correct_output/'

Running the commands above should yield the following output (with
appropriate substitutions for local file paths):
